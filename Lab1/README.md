# Introduction in language representations



## About the project

- ### Part 1: Spell checker

  In the first part, our goal is the implementation of a spell checker using finite state machines. The FSTs are designed with the [OpenFst](<http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/WebHome>) library. The steps are described in project-statement.pdf and the implementation in the jupyter notebooks.

- ### Part 2: Sentiment analysis

  In the second part, a sentiment classifier is implemented that categorizes reviews for movies in IMDB to positive and negative. First, the representation of data is a simple bag of words and then Word2Vec embeddings are used in order to enhance the performance of the classifier.



## Table of contents:

- __ProLab:__ Contains a preparation of the spell checker and a introduction to word embeddings.:
- __Lab:__ Contains the main part of the project.
- __ProLab/report.ipynb and Lab/report.ipynb:__ The description and the whole implementation of the project in two parts.

- The use of the remaining bash scripts is explained in the norebooks.
