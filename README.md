## Table of contents:

- __Lab 1: Introduction to language representations though the creation of a spell checker and the implementation of a sentiment classification model.__ In the first part of the project, a spell checker is implemented by using the openFST library and python scipts.

All necessary files will be produced automatically.

- __Lab 2:__ Implementation of a speech recoginition system using the KALDI TOOLKIT.
