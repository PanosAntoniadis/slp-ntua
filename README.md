# Lab exercises of Speech and Language Processing course in NTUA


## Table of contents:

- __Lab 1: Introduction to language representations.__ In the first part of the project, a spell checker is implemented by using the openFST library and python scripts. In the second part, a sentiment classifier is implemented that categorizes reviews for movies in IMDB to positive and negative. More information about the procedure can be found in the description of the project (in Greek). In order to run the project, open the .ipynb files through jupyter and just run each cells. All necessary files will be produced automatically.
- __Lab 2: Implementation of a speech recognition system using the KALDI toolkit.__ The task is phone recognition given a set of recordings from 4 different speakers.
- __Lab 3: Text classification in two datasets using glove embeddings.__ In 'ProLab' folder, a simple feed-forward neural network is implemented and all the preprocessing of the data took place. In 'Lab' folder there is the complete project where many types of neural networks have been used . See the report of the project for more information about the implementation and the results. In order to simplify the training, a parser have been implemented that takes some important parameters from the terminal (model, embeddings, hyperparameters etc).

More information about the projects can be found in README.md of eachs subfolder.


In Lab 1 and Lab 3 the folder __ProLab__ contains a preparation of the concepts that are used in the exercise.
